    "body": "Following up on the 500 errors in #1 and #3 — I connected directly to Postgres and the schema looks incomplete. The later migrations (priority column, due_date, comments table) are all present as files in alembic/versions/ but they were never actually applied to the Postgres database.\n\nI ran `alembic current` inside the container and it returns nothing — as if alembic has never touched this database. But the migration files themselves are definitely correct, I read through all of them.\n\nMy hunch is alembic is falling back to the SQLite URL in alembic.ini instead of connecting to Postgres. I think the env var refactoring from last sprint may have broken something in how the migration config picks up the database connection string.\n\nLow priority compared to the other P0/P1s, but this should be fixed too so deploys work correctly.",
