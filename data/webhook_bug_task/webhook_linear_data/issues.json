    "description": "Multiple user reports of notifications being delivered to wrong channels. See GitHub issues #42 and #45 on acme-corp/webhook-service.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Users receive Slack notifications even though they only have email enabled\n- The problem is intermittent — not every webhook event triggers wrong channels\n- Restarting the service clears the issue temporarily, but it comes back under load\n\n**Suspected area:** Something in the notification dispatch path is leaking channel preferences between users or between webhook events. Could be shared mutable state that isn't being reset properly.\n\n**Repro hint:** Process two webhook events for different users back-to-back. The second user sometimes inherits notification channels from the first.",
