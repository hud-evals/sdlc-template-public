    "description": "## Bug Report\n\nWhen assigning a task to a user via the API, the assignment notification is not being sent. Other notification types (task creation, status changes) work correctly.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a task: `POST /api/tasks` with `{\"title\": \"Test task\"}`\n2. Assign it: `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` with `{\"assignee_id\": \"user-123\"}`\n3. Check notifications: `GET /api/notifications`\n4. No assignment notification appears, but task creation notification was sent\n\n### Expected\nNotification with type assignment should appear in the notification log.\n\n### Actual\nNo notification for assignment. No errors in logs.\n\n### Context\n- This started after the timezone refactor was merged (see GitHub Issue #5)\n- Task creation notifications still work fine\n- The notification service appears healthy — no errors anywhere\n- We suspect something changed in how events are processed after the refactor\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Task assignment notifications are delivered\n- Existing notification types continue to work\n- Fix the root cause, create a PR on GitHub",
