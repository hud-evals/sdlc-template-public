    "description": "## Bug Report\n\nCustomers are being charged incorrect amounts when using discount codes.\n\n### Example\n\n- Cart: 2x Widget ($25.00 each) = $50.00 subtotal\n- Discount code: SAVE10 (10% off)\n- Tax: 8%\n- **Expected total: $48.60**\n- **Actual total: $49.14**\n\nWe've also had reports of discount amounts being a penny off. For example, 10% of $49.99 shows as $4.99 instead of $5.00.\n\n### What we've tried\n\n- Verified the discount code config is correct (SAVE10 = 10%)\n- Verified the tax rate is correct (8%)\n- The pricing pipeline was refactored recently for EU compliance (GitHub Issue #12) — the team reviewed the changes and believes they are correct\n- GitHub Issue #15 and #18 have more investigation details\n\n### Impact\n\n- All orders with percentage-based discount codes are overcharged\n- Customer complaints increasing, refund requests piling up\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Order totals must match the expected calculation\n- All discount types (percentage and flat) must produce correct amounts\n- Fix the root cause(s) and create a PR on GitHub",
