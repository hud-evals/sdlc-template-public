    "body": "When running evaluations locally, `find_reward()` can't parse the reward because `structuredContent` is always `None`. The tool returns it but `_execute_tool` drops it when building `MCPToolResult`.\n\nReproducible with any scenario that uses `structuredContent` for grading. The evaluate tool returns `{\"reward\": 0.85}` as structured content but `find_reward` sees `None`.\n\nI think `_execute_tool` in `environment.py` is constructing the `MCPToolResult` without passing through `structuredContent` from the underlying result.",
