    "body": "## Settings Pipeline Refactor\n\nThe current settings loading code is a mess of nested if/else branches that's hard to follow and maintain. I'm replacing it with a clean dict merge pattern.\n\n### New approach\nUse Python's dict unpacking with a filtered custom dict to overlay user preferences on top of defaults. We clean up null/unset entries from the user's stored settings first so that defaults apply properly for any setting the user hasn't explicitly configured.\n\nThis is a pure refactor — behavior should be identical. The settings write path is untouched.\n\n### Testing\n- Ran the existing settings test suite, all green\n- Manually verified with a few test accounts\n- Premium and free tier accounts both load correctly",
